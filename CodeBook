The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps

Reading the train data sets, the test datasets, the feature vector and the activity labels
x_train.txt : 7352 observations of 561 variables
Training set.
y_train.txt : 7352 observations of 1 variable
Training labels.
subject_train.txt: 7352 observations of 1 variable
contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed
x_test.txt: 2947 observations of 561 variables
Test set.
y_test.txt:2947 observations of 1 variable
Test lables.
subject_test.txt: 2947 observations of 1 variable
contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed
features.txt : 561 observations of 2 variables
List of all features
activity_labels.txt : 6 observations of 2 variables
Links the class labels with their activity name.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
alltrain: 7352 observations of  563 variables is created by merging x_train, y_train and subject_train using the cbind function
alltest:  2947 observations of  563 variables is created by merging x_test, y_test and subject_test using the cbind function
alldata:  10299 observations of  563 variables is created by alltrain and all test using the rbind function

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
alldata: 10299 observations 81 variables is created by extracted only the measurments on the mean and stantard deviation for each measurment by using the command grep

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Entire numbers in activityID column of the alldata replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable using the factor function

Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names using the gsub command
All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time
All mean in column’s name replaced by Mean
All std in column’s name replaced by StandardDeviation
All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
second_dataset with 180 observations and 81 variables is created by sumarizing alldata taking the means of each variable for each activityID and each subjectID, after groupped by subjectID and activityID.
Export second_data into tidy_data.txt file.
